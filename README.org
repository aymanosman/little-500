* Little 500
This repository contains a series of compilers written in Racket following Jeremy Siek's "Essentials of Compilation".

As of yet, the project remains a work in progress. My motivation to implement these programs stems from a desire to learn fundementals of writing programming langagues rather than the drive to invent something new. All implementations follow the book, which explains the specifications for each step, leaving the reader to come up with their own implementation. 

Please see subdirectories (e.g., ~r1/~) for individual compiler implementations.
